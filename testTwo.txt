Many persons who are not conversant with mathematical studies imagine that because the business of [Babbage's Analytical
Engine] is to give its results in numerical notation, the nature of its processes must consequently be arithmetical and
numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an error. The engine can arrange and combine its numerical
quantities exactly as if they were letters or any other general symbols; and in fact it might bring out its results in
algebraical notation, were provisions made accordingly.
